                <h3>Dear Reilly Derkitt</h3>
                <p>
                    How are you? I’m personally doing amazing. Not only is summer weather on it’s way, 
                    but the Frontend Developer Intern position at Shopify has opened up once again. 
                    Whenever this position opens, I’m always excited to see the challenge that awaits. 
                    I use the Shopify mockup challenge as a test to see how far I’ve come,
                    how much I learned and what improvements I can showcase compared to the previous challenge.

                    My name is Kirk and I’m a Third Year Computer Science student at Carleton University. 
                    My passion for frontend development was grown through my experiences in drawing lessons. 
                    The frontend development process and art lessons are relatable for me. In art classes, 
                    I tried to imitate a interesting art piece and in development I imitate the designers illustration. 
                    Something unique to frontend development is how I can make the webpage interactable and it draws my fascination 
                    because it’s makes the art of development come alive. 
                    Experiences I have in development involves my old website that was built using self-applied knowledge of HTML, 
                    CSS and Bootstrap to make the website responsive, I have also learned flexbox and css grid and applied them 
                    to my most recent iteration of my personal website. To further build my skills, 
                    I am going through the Front Loops challenge to see where my code can improve when creating the design. 
                    Recently I have been writing simple programs that utilize object-oriented design patterns in Typescript and unit tests with Mocha. 
                    I also finished a ReactJS YouTube clone, by creating components that changed behaviour depending on the state of the search bar. 
                    Outside of projects, I have presented at Local Hack Day, a day where all students across the globe can participate at a local hackathon.
                    My presentation was about the usage of GraphQL and how to retrieve products from a personal Shopify store. 
                    I was also a part of the CUHacking executive team, where I participated in weekly SCRUM meetings and reached out to 
                    various sponsors that provided cool technologies and interesting workshops for students. Through these experiences, 
                    I’ve gained qualities such as technical knowledge, communication skills, and leadership.
                </br>
                </br>
                    As a developer, I want my work to deliver value to all who use it. What makes me want to be a part of Shopify is when I attended DeCODE hackathon, 
                    working with the talented software engineers and talking about how their code contributed to the end users is an opportunity I would like as well.
                    My passion for researching and applying new technologies, attention to detail, 
                    and commitment to quality ensures that I can be a valuable asset to the Frontend Developer team at Shopify.

                    I feel very privileged to be able to apply to this position. 
                    Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

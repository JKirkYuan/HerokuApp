                <h3>Dear Reilly Derkitt</h3>
                <p>
                    How are you? I’m personally doing amazing. Not only is summer weather on it’s way, 
                    but the Frontend Developer Intern position at Shopify has opened up once again. 
                    Whenever this position opens, I’m always excited to see the challenge that awaits. 
                    I use the Shopify mockup challenge as a test to see how far I’ve come, 
                    how much I learned and what improvements I can use to showcase my progression since the previous challenge.

                    My name is Kirk and I’m a Third Year Computer Science student at Carleton University. 
                    My passion for frontend development was grown through my experiences in drawing lessons. 
                    The frontend development process and art lessons are very relatable for me. 
                    In art classes I imitate an interesting art piece and in development I recreate the designers illustration. 
                    It makes programming feel like an artwork and that’s where I found my main passion for Computer Science. 
                    Something unique to frontend development is how I can make the webpage interactable. 
                    It draws my fascination because it’s makes the art of development come alive. 
                    My first experience in personal projects development was my old website that I built after teaching myself HTML, 
                    CSS and Bootstrap to make the website responsive. More recently I learned how to use Flexbox and CSS Grid, 
                    and applied them to my current iteration of my personal website. 
                    To further build my skills, I am going through the Front Loops HTML/CSS challenge to see where my 
                    code can improve when re-creating the design. To apply what I learned in school, 
                    I have been converting simple programs from Java that utilize object-oriented design patterns 
                    into Typescript and writing unit tests for those programs with Mocha. I also finished a ReactJS YouTube clone, 
                    utilizing Babel to write components and Webpack to bundle the scripts. 
                    Outside of personal projects, I have presented at Local Hack Day, a day where all students across the globe 
                    participate in a hackathon near them. 
                    My presentation was about the benefits of GraphQL and how to retrieve products from a personal Shopify store using GraphQL queries.
                    I was also a part of the CUHacking executive team, where I participated in weekly SCRUM meetings and reached out to 
                    various sponsors that provided cool technologies and interesting workshops for students. 
                    Through these experiences, I’ve gained qualities such as technical knowledge, communication skills, and leadership.

                    My motivation for applying to Shopify began when I attended DeCODE to work with Shopify interns, 
                    where they talked about how their code contributed to the end user experience. 
                    As a developer, working for Shopify will give me the opportunity to deliver value through my programs 
                    and will allow me to maximize my work ethic and commitment to quality. 
                    My eagerness for researching and applying new technologies, oral and written communication skills,
                    and attention to detail ensures that I can be a valuable asset to the Frontend Developer team at Shopify.

                    I feel very privileged to be able to apply to this position.

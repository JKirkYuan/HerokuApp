							<h3>Gob Bluth 🍌</h3>
							Hi! </br>
							My name is Jiatian, but I prefer to be called Kirk 😃 </br>

							I am currently a second year computer science student at Carleton University! (This is so generic)🤣 </br></br>

							I have a passion for front-end web development, and I also fancy beautiful design patterns (The visual guide on Shopify Polaris is beautiful) 🎆</br>
							To start off, I have a decent art background, I took art lessons since middle school up to the end of highschool. I started University off really rough, I had no prior experience
							to coding and flunking a couple of programming tests didnt help either, I was ready to give up until I told myself that nothing was going to be easy, I decided to see how I feel at the end of first year
							,and here I am, still in the Computer Science program 👌 </br></br>
							The passion I have for web development grew during the summer after first year, I was a software intern for a small company in Beijing and due to
							my limited knowledge, there was little that I was able to do (Mostly checking to see if database had errors)😅 </br></br>
							I was helping around and one of the first people I met at work introduced me to a simple Apache Tomcat local server.
							I had a lot of fun working with HTML and CSS and one of the more interesting web pages that was not blocked in China was the CSS Zen Garden, it's where I drew a lot of inspiration from.</br></br>

							During my second year in University, I wanted to push myself to do more web development, so I picked up Bootstrap! This personal website was basically a place where I
							tested different features and learned by creating👍. </br> I also attended two different hackathons, the first hackathon was the Concordia Hacks, my team built a Android Application where
							patients could interact with doctors, although not knowing a lot of Android, I helped with setting up the XML pages and scraped together a functioning website to make our app look presentable.📊
						</br>The second hackathons I attended was the DeCode hackathon where I had the pleasure of working with Shopify interns and different students from Ottawa on a Shopify App that managed giveaways. I sat along side a full stack
							developer and helped test and gave suggestions on how to implement the backend of the app (RAILS CONTROLLERS WORK LIKE MAGIC!)🎩. </br>Unsatisfied with the little workload I did throughout the hackathon, I
							went home and hacked away to make modifications to our page where applicants would sign up to our giveaway. It resulted in positive feedback through a friend from the hackathon and I can't wait to be working on
							the application during the summer!</br></br>

							Thank you for taking the time to read this Gob Bluth 🍌. Hopefully, you find me to be a good fit for the Shopify Developer Intern position,
						  super looking forward to hearing from you soon!🤗</br>
							-Kirk
